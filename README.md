# CAT-APP

[CAT-APP](https://cat-app-kappa.vercel.app/) is a react app built as an upgrade to my original nodejs command line tool for the Canadian Alcoholometric Tables.

[NodeJS alc-tbl repo](https://github.com/uncleBlobby/alc-tbl-3)

### About

The Canadian Alcoholometric Tables are available in hardcover form from the Canada Revenue Agency; it is a monstrous book, more than 600 pages containing one
single data table (130,000+ rows) that is required for distillers to legally determine the alcohol content of their spirits.  

Typically, to measure the alcohol content of their spirits, distillers must take a temperature and density reading from their sample and then look up the corresponding information in the government supplied data table.  This process is cumbersome not only because the instruments used to gather these readings are EXTREMELY FRAGILE GLASS and very expensive to have certified by Measurement Canada, but also because the book of tabulated data is such a dense piece.

I've created this app in order to save a little bit of time in the day-to-day life of the average Canadian distiller.  The app will ask you for your temperature and density readings, and then look up the corresponding information in the book for you, saving you precious seconds of flipping to the right page and scanning through thousands of lines of data.

Cheers and happy distilling!
